To get started with Kubernetes, you'll need to write YAML configuration files that define the desired state of your applications, services, and other resources. Here's a simple example to deploy a basic Nginx web server using Kubernetes.

1. Create a YAML file for the deployment, for example, `deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This file defines a Deployment with the following:
- `apiVersion: apps/v1`: Specifies the API version to use.
- `kind: Deployment`: Defines the type of resource.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata like the name of the deployment.
- `spec`: Defines the desired state, including the number of replicas, selector, and template.
- `template`: Describes the pod template, including container specifications like the image and port.

2. Create a YAML file for the service, for example, `service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

This file defines a Service with the following:
- `apiVersion: v1`: Specifies the API version to use.
- `kind: Service`: Defines the type of resource.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata like the name of the service.
- `spec`: Defines the desired state, including the selector, ports, and type (LoadBalancer in this case).

3. Apply the YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

These commands will create the Deployment and Service in your Kubernetes cluster.

This is a simple example to get you started. As you become more familiar with Kubernetes, you can create more complex YAML files to define various resources such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress, and more.
